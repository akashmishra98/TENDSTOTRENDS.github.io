            <p>The Beverly Hilton is a hotel located on an 8.9-acre (3.6 ha) property at the intersection of Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards in Beverly Hills, California. 
                The Beverly Hilton has hosted many awards shows, charity benefits, and entertainment and motion picture industry events, 
                and is particularly known as the venue of the annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony.</p>
                <p>Griffin owned the hotel from 1987 to 2003, during which time its reputation faded as maintenance was deferred and competition increased. In 2003, Griffin
                     sold the Beverly Hilton for $130 million to Beny Alagem, co-founder of Packard Bell Electronics, through his company Oasis West Realty. Commemorating its
                      50th anniversary, an ambitious $80 million renovation by architecture firm Gensler began in conjunction with Hilton Hotels,
                     which has managed the property since it opened.</p>
